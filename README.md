This is our work for computer science's discipline: "Formal Languages and Compilers" at UFSC\*

To do
=====
    Elaborate an application with a graphic interface to manipulate finite automatons and regular expressions that envolves the following operations:

1 Editing, saving and reading finite automatons and regular expressions
2 Determinizing a non-deterministic finite automaton
3 Minimizing a finite automaton
4 Converting a regular expression to a finite automaton - simoni's algorithm
5 Verification of equivalence of regular expressions through operations with finite automatons
6 Recognizing sentences in a finite automaton and enumeration of accepted sentences of size "n"
7 Extra operation/verification of group's choice
